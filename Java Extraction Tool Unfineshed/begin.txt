The Islamic Bank of Britain, the UK's only retail Islamic bank, is growing strongly in spite of the severe credit squeeze that has wiped billions off the balance sheets of the conventional banks.
The Birmingham-based bank, which has high street branches in London, Manchester and the Midlands, saw its customer numbers rise 38 per cent to 42,000 by the end of 2007, compared with the previous year, while customer deposits grew 61 per cent to a value of £135m. The bank's total assets also jumped 51 per cent to £15.8m at the end of 2007 from £10m at the end of 2006.
Sultan Choudhury, commercial director, said: "Clearly, we are very small compared with the conventional banks, but we are attracting business. Customer numbers have gone up this year as well and our balance sheet continues to grow. I think Islamic banks in general have been less affected by the credit crisis because of the quality of assets they tend to have on their books."
The bank, which was launched in September 2004 to meet the growing demand for religiously compliant banking products from the UK's 2m Muslim community, is still making pre-tax losses, although these contracted to £6.9m at the end of 2007 compared with £8.8m at the end of 2006.
The bank has also tightened up its financing criteria in line with other conventional retail banks as the economic climate has deteriorated. The IBB now demands a 30 per cent deposit on commercial property financing, or loans in conventional terms, rather than 20 per cent this time last year.
The IBB offers personal finance, which is the equivalent of personal unsecured loans in the conventional market, secured commercial financing, savings accounts, which pay out on a profit share basis, current accounts and debit cards.
Islamic finance does not allow the payment of interest, which is banned in the Koran.

Islamic Banking: Steady in Shaky Times; Principles Based on Religious Law Insulate Industry From Worst of Financial Crisis

As big Western financial institutions have teetered one after the other in the crisis of recent weeks, another financial sector is gaining new confidence: Islamic banking.
Proponents of the ancient practice, which looks to sharia law for guidance and bans interest and trading in debt, have been promoting Islamic finance as a cure for the global financial meltdown.
This week,  Kuwait's commerce minister, Ahmad Baqer, was quoted as saying that the global crisis will prompt more countries to use Islamic principles in running their economies. U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert M. Kimmet, visiting Jiddah, said experts at his agency have been learning the features of Islamic banking.
Though the trillion-dollar Islamic banking industry faces challenges with the slump in real estate and stock prices, advocates say the system has built-in protection from the kind of runaway collapse that has afflicted so many institutions. For one thing, the use of financial instruments such as derivatives, blamed for the downfall of banking, insurance and investment giants, is banned. So is excessive risk-taking.
"The beauty of Islamic banking and the reason it can be used as a replacement for the current market is that you only promise what you own. Islamic banks are not protected if the economy goes down -- they suffer -- but you don't lose your shirt," said Majed al-Refaie, who heads Bahrain-based Unicorn Investment Bank.
The theological underpinning of Islamic banking is scripture that declares that collection of interest is a form of usury, which is banned in Islam. In the modern world, that translates into an attitude toward money that is different  from that found in the West: Money cannot just sit and generate more money. To grow, it must be invested in productive enterprises.
"In Islamic finance you cannot make money out of thin air," said Amr al-Faisal, a board member of Dar al-Mal al-Islami, a holding company that owns several Islamic banks and financial institutions. "Our dealings have to be tied to actual economic activity, like an asset or a service. You cannot make money off of money. You have to have a building that was actually purchased, a service actually rendered, or a good that was actually sold."
In the Western world, bankers designing investment instruments have to satisfy government regulators. In Islamic banking, there is another group to please -- religious regulators called a sharia board. Finance lawyers work closely with Islamic finance scholars, who study and review a product before issuing a fatwa, or ruling, on its compliance with sharia law.
Islamic bankers describe depositors as akin to partners -- their money is invested, and they share in the profits or, theoretically, the losses that result. (In interviews, bankers couldn't recall a case in which depositors actually lost money; this shows that banks put such funds only in very low-risk investments, they said.)
Rather than lend money to a home buyer and collect interest on it, an Islamic bank buys the property and then leases it to the buyer for the duration of the loan. The client pays a set amount each month to the bank, then at the end obtains full ownership. The payments are structured to include the cost of the house, plus a predetermined profit margin for the bank.
Sharia-compliant institutions also cannot invest in alcohol, pornography, weapons, gambling, tobacco or pork.
Computer engineer Tarek al-Bassam said the crisis made him glad that he had chosen an Islamic bank to take his money. His Islamic savings account has made  about 4 percent profit, he said. "Usually it's a very low risk or a very low gain. But I'm happy with it," Bassam said.
He has also borrowed from an Islamic bank, to buy a building. Even if he's late in his payments, he said, he will not have to pay cumulative interest or a larger sum than the one agreed upon. But he notes that under this system, it can be harder to get a loan than from a conventional bank. Islamic banks have stricter lending  rules and require that their borrowers provide more collateral and have higher income.
Islamic banking has grown by about 15 percent a year since its modern inception in the 1970s, fueled by the Middle East oil boom of that decade. "There was a lot of hostility when we first started out. We were regarded with suspicion, especially by the regulatory authorities. We were an odd fish. Authorities only acquiesced when they saw the huge demand," said Dar al-Mal al-Islami's Faisal, who has been in Islamic finance since the late 1970s.
Islamic finance now accounts for about  1 percent of the global market, according to Majid Dawood, chief executive of Yasaar, a Dubai-based  sharia financing consultancy. "We had expected to be at 12 percent of the global market by 2025, but now with this financial crisis, we expect to get there much faster," he said in a telephone interview from New York, where he  was speaking at a conference on Islamic banking.
Growth in Islamic banking picked up even before the current financial crisis, mainly  because of strong client demand for safe, religiously acceptable investments and a recent explosion in new and innovative financial instruments, said Jane Kinninmont, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a research and advisory company.
Islamic banks now offer credit cards in which the full balance must be paid off at month's end. They have devised a kind of commercial paper known as sukuk, which generates a predetermined return that is called a profit, not interest. It is tied to a specific asset and conveys ownership of it. A sukuk might be issued by a government or a company that is building a hospital or a bridge, for example.
Work in Islamic banking by the King & Spalding law firm has grown roughly 40-fold in the past four years, according to Jawad Ali, a Dubai-based partner at the firm. The firm has 35 lawyers "who do nothing but structure  sharia-compliant investment and financing on a daily basis," he said.
Islamic finance first sparked interest in the United States in the late 1990s. The Dow Jones Islamic Index was established in 1999, and the Dow Jones Islamic Fund, which invests in  sharia-compliant companies, the following year.
But interest cooled after some Islamic banks were accused of financing terrorism in a lawsuit filed by family members of Sept. 11, 2001, victims, and a lot of Persian Gulf money left the United States for Europe.
In 2004, the German state of Saxony-Anhalt issued a 100 million-euro sovereign Islamic bond. That same year, the first Islamic bank opened in Britain, which now has six Islamic financial institutions, including a retail bank.
Although the biggest Islamic banks are in the Persian Gulf -- Dubai Islamic Bank, Kuwait Finance House and Saudi Arabia's al-Rajhi Bank -- Malaysia and London are growing as major centers of Islamic banking as well.
Islamic institutions are not immune to ills plaguing other banks, such as corruption charges and bad investments.  Differences of interpretation between  sharia scholars about what is permissible and what isn't also create confusion. The sukuk market, which had doubled each year since 2004, growing to a total of about $90 billion  in bonds issued, fell 50 percent this year after a Bahrain-based group of Islamic scholars decreed that most of the bonds were not compatible with  sharia law.
But as banks turn borrowers away in these times of economic turmoil, Islamic institutions continue to close deals in Europe, the Gulf and the United States, bankers said. "Banks feel safer and more comfortable with us because we put down more money, more equity. We are not allowed to borrow with very little down," said Tariq Malhance, a former chief financial officer for the city of Chicago who now heads Unicorn  Investment Bank's U.S. office.
And those who have been in Islamic banking for a long time now feel vindicated.
"The current financial collapse is an opportunity. The ugly side of Wall Street is exposed; it's always been there but covered by a layer of glamour that is now stripped away," Faisal said. "We are more conservative and sober in our investments. That used to be considered a handicap. Now it's considered the height of wisdom."

From niche market into mainstream; Islamic banks need to tackle regulatory hurdles to get out of their protected markets, says consultancy McKinsey. SAID ABDULLAH reports

THE global Islamic banking industry had assets of some US$400 billion last year, and is experiencing growth of 15 to 20 per cent annually. But to get to the next level, it must first tackle a host of regulatory practices if it wants to get out of its protected market and enter the mainstream with full force, says McKinsey Quarterly in its latest survey.
The once niche-market based Islamic institutions have spread from enclaves in North Africa and the Middle East and South-east Asia to become a worldwide phenomenon: there are now more than 270 Islamic banks, including subsidiaries of conventional banks, such as HSBC Amanah and Citi Islamic Investment Bank.
Islamic banking has grown faster than the banking sector as whole in countries from Malaysia to Saudi Arabia, although profitability and returns on assets display a mixed picture. However, the US management consultancy pointed out that despite its recent rapid growth, assets held by Islamic banks stand at less than one per cent of global banking assets with penetration varying considerably even in Islamic countries. For instance, in Indonesia, Islamic banks account for slightly more than one per cent of total banking assets while in Kuwait, it is 21 per cent and in Malaysia it is just above 11 per cent.
But McKinsey said recent research of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states - Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - revealed tremendous growth potential: 75 per cent of the respondents said they prefer Islamic banks and would switch to Islamic banks if their products were at least on par with those of the conventional banks.
But given the legacy of serving a core of devout clientele who are prepared to accept lower product and service standards in exchange for syariah compliance, some Islamic institutions are slow to respond to competition from conventional banks.
There is also a patchwork of regulations that try to balance religious conformity with economic reality that is hampering realisation of its potential, McKinsey contends.
The US consultancy firm points out regulators need to ensure that there is a competitive and harmonised banking environment to improve the quality of services and products. More importantly, a move towards standardisation will also help create the platform for Islamic banks to expand beyond national borders and become truly global, McKinsey said.
Because the regulatory frameworks governing Islamic banks strongly influence the banks' overall performance, the wide variation in regulations from country to country has resulted in wide variation in performances across markets.
For instance, in Kuwait, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the Islamic banking sector is dominated by a single player: the Kuwait Finance House, Dubai Islamic Bank, and Al Rajhi Banking and Investment, respectively. Although all three have evolved in more or less the same way, their performance varies widely as do their regulatory environments.
In Kuwait and the UAE, where the Islamic banks have historically enjoyed protection, their performance lags behind the national average for banks in general. However, in Saudi Arabia, with free competition, Al Rajhi has outperformed the market average. Strategic policies and management too contributed significantly to the outcome. McKinsey says countries starting their own Islamic banking regulations should consider how their efforts contribute to international harmonisation of the Islamic banking practices.
Ideally, the report says, the regulatory model that evolves should put Islamic and conventional institutions on the same competitive footing and create a transparent market. Thus, banks should not use syariah tags to hide lax customer service or operations. There should be separate Islamic banking balance sheets and income statements giving a complete picture rather than the asymmetry of present format.
In addition, there are licensing policies to contend with. In most countries with Islamic banks, regulators have to decide whether to allow two very different banking formats to coexist: general licensing policies and those where regulators have to deal with syariah compliance. And there can be extremes of policy: for instance, in Sudan only Islamic banks are allowed to operate while in Oman they are prohibited.
Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, issues a single licence and compliance framework covers all banks, avoiding any differentiation between conventional and Islamic institutions, allowing every bank to offer both conventional and syariah-compliant products. Thus banks can be fully conventional, fully Islamic or a mix of both.
Malaysia issues three kinds of licences, one for each kind of bank - this helps to create a competitive environment and allows banks to chose their own strategy. By contrast, however, in Kuwait a separate banking licence is required for Islamic and conventional banking, the mixed system is not allowed.
McKinsey says Saudi Arabia and Malaysian models have fostered the strongest competition where almost all banks offer a wide range of Islamic products and hence foster a healthy banking environment whilst in Kuwait and UAE, where it is tough to get new Islamic banking licences, few banks naturally offer such products.
No doubt a clear distinction between Islamic and conventional systems might raise the credibility of the Islamic banking sector and quickly meet the need of customers who prefer strict Islamic standards. But it could also result in insulating Islamic banks from competition. Protected Islamic banks may believe that Islamic credentials alone will sustain them, and will thus become often complacent and this will result in innovation, quality of service, convenience and operational improvements suffering.
When banks compete on performance and costs rather than the Islamic credentials, the winners surely are the customers as is evident in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia where conventional banks offer syariah-compliant products through distinct sub brands, particularly in retail banking while in Malaysia conventional banks offering syariah-compliant products via Islamic windows.
Malaysia, where about 60 per cent of the population is Muslim, is positioning itself as a centre for Islamic financial services to attract investors from the Middle East and to compete with Bahrain and other Persian Gulf states. It has an added advantage: by ensuring that Islamic banks report their activities separately, transparency is assured. This is not the case in Saudi Arabia where there is no distinction between Islamic and conventional data.
Since Islamic banking depends on the interpretation of the syariah, to ensure the permissibility or otherwise of a product, and since there is no single authority on such interpretation and application of Islamic law, there is this need for Islamic scholars to rule on new products or services.
A syariah committee within a bank can help create clear governance challenges, particularly when the opinions of its management and board diverge from the syariah panel. A syariah committee can also slow down product development or halt it altogether and this can be a major hurdle since speed is of the essence if Islamic banks are to compete with conventional banks for customers, willing to consider options, innovation and quick delivery, the report says.
For instance, an Islamic bank in the Gulf came up with a new product in two months, but it had to wait three months for the syariah committee to approve it, McKinsey says.
There is also the scarcity of Islamic scholars with financial knowledge.
Malaysia's system of having its central bank convene a national Syariah Board helps to alleviate some of these issues, the US consultancy says. Eminent scholars serve on the board, holding the ultimate authority to approve new products and practices. Although individual banks still have their own syariah committees, their role is to decide how to apply the central bank's opinions and how to to enforce syariah compliance within the bank, McKinsey says.
This central bank transparency could also diminish the impact of governance issues while its rulings help to create a benchmark of acceptable practices and reduce tensions between a bank's management and its syariah panel. To its credit, Malaysia's central bank discusses innovative concepts openly and issues public judgements.
This model, McKinsey says, provided for the more efficient use of a very scarce resource of Islamic scholars and lightens the burden for scholars on the committees of individual banks and allows them to draw upon the central board's opinions, rather than going over the same topic afresh.
More countries may opt for a central syariah board. The State Bank of Pakistan wants Islamic banking to rise fivefold to account for 15 per cent of the nation's banking in the next five years, governor Shamshad Akhtar was reported to have said recently. Pakistan may thus opt for a central syariah panel, the report says. If this trend catches on it can help hasten the process of globally harmonising the industry.

KARACHI - Islamic banking is growing gradually but it owns only 3.4 per cent share of total banking industry that means it does not make the headway as it should have due to lack of public awareness, limited products and inability to meet with all the requirements of corporate loans and services.
 This was the virtual consensus view of the bankers, scholars and businessmen at a seminar organised by Primedia Inc on "Islamic Banking & Investment - Progress & Potential" at FPCCI House. 
 They said that the rigid system was not compatible with dynamics of the banking market and, therefore, could not make any headway. It is moving ahead slowly to become more easy and practical choice over conventional banking, they added. 
 FPCCI Vice Chairman Zubair Tufail, who chaired the seminar, said that due to the policies of SBP, Islamic banking is making progress but the business community is expecting towards more incentives and products and hoped that in coming 5 years, Islamic banking sector will secure its due share. 
 Mirza Ikhtiar Baig, Co Chairman and Senior Vice Chairman Banking Committee FPCCI, said that Islamic banking has secured 3.4pc market share during last ten years in Pakistan, whereas, the ratio in Malaysia is 12pc. He suggested that Islamic banks and business community should worked out a mechanism which will be acceptable to both the parties to remove the problems faced by the business community from Islamic banks. He stressed to create Islamic banks consortium for corporate finance.
 SBP Executive Director Azhar Kureshi said that being the regulatory body State Bank is endeavouring towards the progress of Islamic banking in country. 
 He said, to make the Islamic banking sector more functional, the State Bank is issuing licenses separate from conventional banking in different ways. "We are way behind in Islamic banking from many countries but their Islamic banking age is 40 to 50 years where Islamic banking in Pakistan has not completed even ten years," he pointed out. He was confident that about 15 to 20 per cent of banking assets will come under Islamic banking by 2010.
 The SBP official recalled earlier setbacks in Islamic banking during decade of eighties when a rigid system was introduced with a revolutionary zeal rather than taking an evolutionary path. 
 Meanwhile, Dadabhoy Institute of Higher Education recently organised a national level seminar on 'New Global Initiatives in Islamic Banking & Finance' with special reference to Pakistan. Pervez Said, Adviser to SBP Governor, and Director Islamic Banking was the chief guest. 
 Addressing the audience, he said that Islamic banking system is rapidly increasing in the country and Pakistan's Islamic banking industry has become one of the fastest growing banking industries of the country. 
 He said in the past several practices were made for introduction of Islamic banking in Pakistan, and added three years ago Islamic banking was introduced in the country and present six Islamic banks were functioning in the country. Leading international conventional banks, including Citibank, Deutsche Bank had also started Islamic banking that is 100pc based on Islamic Shariah, he said. 
 He said that the customers could now trust the Islamic banking products of the foreign banks. He pointed out that the conventional banking is based only on a single contract while the Islamic banking has 21.
 Head of South, Albaraka Islamic Bank, Ahmed Shuja Kidwai, said that presently over 500 institutions of Islamic banking were working across the world, while in the Pakistan, 13 conventional had started Islamic banking services with separate branches, besides six were completely Islamic. 
 Dr Ahsan Khan, former CEO & Director, United Bank Mutual Fund and former Advisor Islamic Banking to UBL, Mujeeb Baig SVP, Dawood Islamic Bank, Hammad Rasool, Director Finance, Wapda also addressed to the occasion.

MALAYSIAN, QATARI BANKS TO VENTURE INTO ISLAMIC BANKING

KARACHI - Malaysia and Qatar-based full-fledged Islamic banks are keen to open branches in Pakistan by entering into the fastest growing Islamic financial market of the region.
 Sources told The Nation on Monday that being a large Muslim population country, Pakistan is a good target for Malaysian and Qatari banks that can capture untapped potential of Islamic banking in the country. Sources said that some banks of the said countries were looking into the possibility of starting Islamic banking in the country and they could approach the SBP for obtaining banking license.
 Meanwhile, it is important to note here that during the mid of the current year, Mybank, a trade name for Malayan Banking Bhd and the largest bank of Malaysia, had shown its inertest to acquire local banks of Pakistan. The bank had entered into the phase of negotiation with some high financial groups in Pakistan for making joint ventures and buy-out arrangements but the deal between two stakeholders could not be reached at final stage. 
 According to the banking sector experts, Islamic finance industry of Pakistan is comprised of across-the-board financial institutions/markets including onshore and offshore commercial banks, non-bank financial companies, housing cooperatives, microfinance institutions, venture capitals, mutual funds, Takaful companies, capital markets etc. Moreover, there are dedicated regulatory, legal and academic institutions at the international level that are providing support in establishing and developing the IFS.
 The nationwide full-fledged Islamic Scheduled Banks' numbers of branches have increased by 117 during the seven months of the current calendar year (CY07) by making up to 3pc market share from 3pc in the CY06.
 It is expected that in next few years, the share of Islamic banks would grow to 10 per cent of the commercial banking. The total assets of banks have increased to Rs 135.64 billion by March 2007 from Rs 118.18 billion in December 2006, showing 15 per cent growth in just three months.
 Islamic banking kicked off in Pakistan in 2003, when Meezan Bank got the first-ever license. In 2003, the share of Islamic banks was only 0.5 per cent of the conventional banking. However, by March 2007, the Islamic banks share has increased to three per cent that shows an encouraging growth. The Islamic banks would have to make efforts to maintain growth along with the commercial banks in the country. The deposits with the Islamic banks have increased to Rs 180 billion, with the estimate that these deposits would expand to around Rs 200 billion by the end of this year.
 According to the State Bank report on Islamic banking sector growth during CY06, the total assets of this segment grew by almost 67pc to Rs 119 billion, thus, increasing its share in the overall banking system to 2.9pc from 2pc in CY05. Infection ratio (gross) stayed at 1.3 percent while ROA remained at 0.9pc. Building a specialized human resource would help Islamic banking system foster as a successful parallel banking system.
 However, in 2006, all the 39 commercial banks made Rs 84 billion after-tax profit. But only five large local banks had a seventy per cent share in it, the latest data released by the State Bank reveal. The commercial banks combined had a 52 per cent share in the overall advances of the banking system that totalled Rs2.389 trillion.
 Islamic Finance industry has made considerable progress at both the global and national front. Especially, during the last decade the Islamic Financial Sector (IFS) has registered a robust growth (between 15 to 20 percent per annum); making it one of the fastest growing segments of the overall financial system of the world. As a result, today the Islamic financial industry is comprised of across-the-board financial institutions / markets including onshore and offshore commercial banks, non-bank financial companies, housing cooperatives, microfinance institutions, venture capitals, mutual funds, Takaful companies, capital markets etc. 
 Moreover, there are dedicated regulatory, legal and academic institutions at the international level that are providing support in establishing and developing the IFS. The growing interest in Islamic banking in the year under review is also evident by the entry of three new conventional banks having Islamic banking branches. These include Askari Bank Limited, UBL, and NBP. Moreover ABN Amro has also started operations in second quarter of the CY07. Making the tally of conventional banks having Islamic Banking Branches to thirteen.

KARACHI - Islamic banks are losing tens of millions of rupees profit, as the government had yet not issued Bailtul Mal Certificates that aimed at sucking the surplus liquidity of the Islamic banks in the country. For the past many months the Islamic banks were demanding of the government to issue Baitul Mal Certificates so that the banks could utilize billions of rupees excess liquidity. Recently the caretaker govt had promised with the high ups of the Islamic banks that the certificates would be issued shortly, but the banks are still waiting the BMCs to invest their money and to earn profit.
 The federal govt is too much time in starting the Baitul Mal Certificates that has irritated the bankers, belonging to Islamic banks. It may be noted here that the Islamic banks have made an astounding growth during the past few years, there major problem of investing surplus equity still remained a dream.
 The nationwide full-fledged Islamic Scheduled Banks' numbers of branches have increased to 122 during current calendar year (CY07). With the entry of 3 more conventional banks, the total number of conventional banks offering Islamic banking increased to 13 whereas the full-fledged operating Islamic banks have increased to 6 from 4 in CY06 with 122 branches during CY07.
 Similarly, two more Islamic banks are planning to enter into Pakistan. One is Qatar Islamic Bank, a Qatar-based full-fledged Islamic banking company and the other is Bahrain-based Al Salam Bank. With their entrance the total number of banks offering full-fledged Islamic banking will increase to 8 in 2008. Both Islamic banking companies are set to commence its operations in Pakistan soon with paid up capital of 100 million dollars each initially while they may increase the capital at a later stage.
 According to the State Bank report on Islamic banking sector growth and trends during quarter of the CY07, the total assets of this segment grew by almost 80 percent to Rs 159 billion thus increasing its share in the overall banking system to 3.4 percent from 2.9 percent in CY06. 
 As far as Islamic banking industry 's market share is concerned, it's deposits increased by 3.1pc to Rs 108 billion as at the end of June 2007 from Rs 83 billion at end December 2007. Financing and Investment in the industry surged to 2.6 percent to Rs 90b in CY07 from 2.4pc or Rs 72b in the past calendar year. 
 The statistical description on Islamic banking player during the last calendar year revealed the total Islamic banking branches increased to 183 from 87 in the CY06. 
 Islamic Finance industry has made considerable progress at both the global and national front. Especially, during the last decade the Islamic Financial Sector (IFS) has registered a robust growth (between 15 to 20 percent per annum); making it one of the fastest growing segments of the overall financial system of the world. As a result, today the Islamic financial industry is comprised of across-the-board financial institutions / markets including onshore and offshore commercial banks, non-bank financial companies, housing cooperatives, microfinance institutions, venture capitals, mutual funds, Takaful companies, capital markets etc. Moreover, there are dedicated regulatory, legal and academic institutions at the international level that are providing support in establishing and developing the IFS.
 In Pakistan, the Islamic banking system has witnessed a very healthy growth during the last couple of years and is steadily proving its potential to work as a compatible and parallel alternative system for providing financial services. It is growing in terms of size and structure. The growing interest in Islamic banking in the year under review is also evident by the entry of three new conventional banks having Islamic banking branches. These include Askari Bank Limited, United Bank Limited, and National Bank of Pakistan. Moreover ABN Amro has also started operations in second quarter of the CY07, making the tally of conventional banks having Islamic Banking Branches to thirteen. 
 It is interesting to note that the conventional banks are increasingly realizing the huge potential market backed by the untapped and steadily growing appetite for Islamic banking products; hence the drive for entering this market is based on business considerations in addition to religious considerations.
 The Balance Sheet footing of the Islamic Banking Industry increased during the past quarter. The total assets portfolio in the Islamic Banking Sector expanded by 17% to Rs 158,990 million in June 2007 from Rs 135,641 million in March 2007.
 Financings constituted 49.6% of the total assets and stood at Rs 78,834 million in June 2007 as compared to Rs 69,993 million at the end of March 2007, showing an increase of 13%. There was a decrease in "Balances with other banks". Balances held by Islamic Banking Institutions at the other Banks decreased by 17% to Rs 18,464 million from Rs 22,192 million, Deposits increased by 16pc to Rs 108,293 million as at the end of June 2007 from Rs 93,068 million at end March 2007. Islamic Banking Sector's equity increased by 21% to Rs 25,238 million as of June 2007 from Rs 20,925 million at the end of March 2007. Reason for this increase are Booking of quarterly profits by the banks.
 Unappropriated/unremitted profit as at the end of quarter (June 2007) increased by 29% to stand at Rs 1,106 million in comparison to the previous quarter's figures of Rs 860 million. Deposits by customers have increased by 20pc. Deposits by financial institutions have decreased by 6%. Fixed Deposits by customers constitute 37% of the total deposits depicting customers' preference toward long term fixed deposits.
 Financing is almost 44.4% of the total financing by the IBI's as of the quarter ending June 2007. ò Second most widely used mode of Finance is Ijarah Financing accounting for about 30.2% of the total financing. Diminishing Musharakah has increase by 29% and accounts for 19.9% as compared to 17% in March 2007 of the total financing.
 The total number of borrowers increased by 20% over the previous quarter while overall financial position of the Islamic Banking Industry is strong as depicted by the ratio analysis. Earning and Profitability Ratios have showed a decline in profitability. The probable reason for this decline is that the Islamic Banking Industry asset base has increased. The increase in Total Assets is 17%. Another probable reason is the increase in provisioning of the NPFs. The asset quality ratios reflect that the quality of financing of the Islamic Banking Institutions is very strong. NPFs to financing are just 1.0% which depicts that a minimal part of financing is going bad.

Malayan Banking Bhd, although not having a standalone Islamic bank, is Asia-Pacific's largest Islamic banking service provider with US$6.4 billion (RM22.48 billion) Syariah-compliant assets, according to The Asian Banker Research.
In its inaugural survey of Islamic banking institutions in the region, The Asian Bankers said the Syariah-complaint assets held by Maybank's Islamic banking window is about 50% more than Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd, the biggest full-fledged Islamic bank and second largest player in the region.
It also said Malaysia leads the pack with 17 institutions holding 73% of the top 40's total assets. The survey, The Asian Banker Islamic Bank 40 (IB40), identifies and ranks the 40 key players in the region.
Banks in only six countries within the Asia-Pacific made it into the IB40 ranking: Bangladesh, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Philippines. They either have standalone Islamic banking operations or Islamic windows as part of a conventional commercial bank.
"Malaysia's efforts in positioning itself as an Islamic banking hub are paying off -- despite similar ambitions from neighbouring Brunei and Singapore, the country is the undeniable centre of Islamic banking activity in the region," said Zhang Wei, research analyst at The Asian Banker.
He said Islamic banking is a relatively new concept in many countries, but had been in Malaysia since 1983. Malaysia now has 10 full-fledged Islamic banks, with more banks planning to spin off their Islamic banking windows into standalone Islamic banks.
Zhang said despite the Muslim majority in Malaysia, Islamic banking assets accounted for only 10.8% of total banking sector assets in the country. "The penetration of Islamic banking in other countries is much lower, even in Pakistan, where 97% of its population is Muslim."
He said the top 40 Islamic banking institutions reported a 20.9% asset growth to nearly US$40 billion -- more than three times the average 6.6% growth of the region's 300 largest banks.
"We do not expect this growth cycle to slow down in the next three to five years, given the sheer population size of the 700 million Muslims in the region and the low penetration of Islamic banking in the financial services sector.
"Nor is Islamic banking limited to Muslim adherents; the principles of Syariah banking are applicable to investors of all religious followings," Zhang said.
The survey said the average return on asset (ROA) demonstrated by the top 40 Islamic banking players was only 0.76%, a "smidgen higher" than the average 0.7% of the 300 largest banks despite much stronger asset growth.
"Both are also much lower than the reported figures of leading global financial institutions such as HSBC and Citigroup," Zhang said.
He said: "One key factor affecting the profitability of Islamic banks is the lack of options and flexibility in optimising the use of the funds provided by Muslim as well as non-Muslim depositors and investors, specifically for Islamic banking products."
Zhang said many Islamic banks had to maintain very large cash surpluses on their books to meet short-term deposit withdrawal obligations and working capital needs.
"This is because the conventional interest-based interbank market for short-term liquidity management is not regarded as Syariah-compliant," he said.
Zhang said markets in the region had yet to develop a short-term Riba-free facility with sufficient depth to alleviate the heavy opportunity cost burden of Islamic banking players.
Syariah law prohibits Riba (the collection and payment of interest), gambling, which may encompass trading in financial risk and investing in businesses that are considered prohibited (haram), such as businesses that manufacture or sell alcohol or pork.
"Moreover, exceptional lending growth in the past few years has put pressure on available pools of capital for many Islamic banks.
"Unlike their conventional banking counterparts which are able to securitise part of their book to regain liquidity and obtain fee income, Islamic banks in many countries do not have this option due to the absence of a secondary market for Islamic financing.
"Further, many banks do not fully understand the intricacies of Islamic banking products," he said.
Zhang said Islamic financial institutions were also hindered by poor risk management skills as conventional hedging techniques like using derivatives and short-selling were often regarded as 'speculative activities' that were not compliant with Syariah principles.
"However, these challenges tend to be less pronounced in the Islamic banking windows of conventional commercial banks.
"The parent institution usually handles all treasury operations on behalf of the Islamic banking window and absorbs part of the overheads such as technology and premise costs," he said.
On the other hand, many strict Muslim investors also consider these institutions less 'pure' as far as Syariah principles are concerned, and are hence less willing to fund these activities.
"This is probably one of the reasons why we are seeing more and more Malaysian banks spinning off their Islamic windows into standalone Islamic banks to enhance the attractiveness of the proposition to the Muslim community," Zhang said.

LAHORE: Branch Less Banking will promote Islamic banking and the efforts of State Bank of Pakistan in this respect are commendable. This was stated by Mr.  Zubair Mughal, Chief Executive Officer of AlHuda Center of Islamic Banking & Economics while speaking to the representatives of Media.
 He said that the Islamic banks can introduce their Islamic Financial services and products in the rural areas and in those areas where Islamic banking has not been introduced yet, without a branch through branchless banking effectively. This would also enable the rural areas to benefit from the services of Islamic Banks and would also further strengthen the idea of Islamic Micro Finance in those areas.  
 He appreciated the efforts of the Governor State Bank of Pakistan for promotion and growth of Islamic banking in rural areas and said that the State Bank of Pakistan has already advised the 20% existing network of Islamic banks to operate in the rural sector and this vision would be even more strengthened because of the branchless banking.
 He gave some facts on the networking of Islamic banks in the rural areas and stated that to date, 6 fully functional Islamic and 12 conventional banks are operating 186 and 103 branches respectively in the rural areas out of which 19 are operating in less developed areas. While Bank Islami is most prominent with respect to its fast branch network growth and expansion of its services in the said areas.  
 He further added that in order to introduce the services and products of Islamic banks effectively in the rural areas, it is necessary for the Islamic banks to introduce agriculture and small medium related Islamic financial products, such products may be designed on the basis of Bai Salam, Bai Istisna, Muzarahah Shirikah etc. which are Shariah compliable, so that the farmer can benefit from them as and when required. Infact products like Ijarah, Murabaha, and Diminishing Musharaka are already in the market for the medium and cottage industry.
 He informed the media that Al-Huda CIBE will host a 1 day workshop on 'Islamic Agriculture Finance' at NIBAF, State Bank of Pakistan , Islamabad on 16th May, 08, to help & educate Islamic bankers on Islamic Agricultural finance mechanism. He said that not only the rural areas would benefit from branchless banking, but the developed areas would also benefit through mobile banking where Islamic banking services are not
 available and it would facilitate in the growth of the I.T. and telecommunication companies in the country which would in turn facilitate the Islamic banking sector.

Islamic banking target on track? Don't bank on it

IS INDONESIA'S Islamic banking sector finally set to take off?
Anxious to benefit from the increasing wealth of the oil-rich Middle East, Jakarta has recently stepped up efforts to tap into the fast-growing international Islamic financial market.
In June, the local Islamic banking industry got a boost when Parliament approved a new Islamic banking law. And last month, a parliamentary working committee approved a government plan to issue the country's first Islamic bonds.
Indeed, the country's renewed enthusiasm for Islamic finance is hard to miss.
Bank Indonesia (Jakarta's central bank) governor Boediono even expressed the hope recently that the country would soon become a centre for Islamic finance studies.
A closer look, however, suggests that it may be some time before Islamic financial instruments become a significant part of the local banking scene.
Despite its status as the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation, Indonesia has been slow to develop Islamic banking. This is partly because, until recently, the main impetus came from Islamic scholars and intellectuals who often disagreed among themselves about how syariah principles prohibiting the payment and receipt of interest should be applied in a modern economy.
The situation is in sharp contrast to Malaysia, where Islamic banking has been actively encouraged since the early 1980s.
Indonesia's first fully syariah-compliant bank, Bank Muamalat Indonesia, was neglected by policymakers not long after it was established in 1991. Thus, while Malaysia's Bank Islam (established in 1983) was listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange as early as 1992, Indonesia's Bank Muamalat remains a minor player in its country.
Interest in Islamic banking revived in the late 1990s with the realisation that Bank Muamalat did not suffer as badly from the 1997 Asian financial crisis as many of the country's more conventional banks did.
Buoyed in part by a simultaneous resurgence of mainstream orthodoxy among Muslims, two more Islamic banks were established - Bank Syariah Mandiri, now the largest syariah bank by assets, and Bank Syariah Mega Indonesia.
Since then, several conventional banks, including foreign-owned institutions, have established syariah windows. These are not separate institutions, but specialised units offering syariah-compliant financial instruments.
Even so, Islamic banking in Malaysia has made far greater strides. According to central bank figures, syariah banking businesses in Indonesia accounted for just 1.98 per cent of the total bank lending in February. The comparable ratio for Malaysia is 12 per cent.
June's legislation seeks to boost Islamic banking by providing it with a stronger legal basis. But several important obstacles still need to be overcome if the principles of syariah law are to make significant inroads into Indonesia's banking sector.
One of the most publicised is the fact that the newly approved legislation fails to deal with the issue of double taxation. Syariah transactions often involve the purchase of assets, which remain the property of the bank until they are sold back to the debtor.
But while such transactions are technically subject to tax, The Straits Times understands that an informal understanding with the Directorate-General of Tax has enabled Islamic banks to side-step the problem. Moves are also being made to remove the legal uncertainty so that it will not discourage investors from injecting fresh funds into syariah institutions.
A far more serious impediment to the growth of such banks is the shortage of trained staff, together with a lack of public familiarity with the products and services offered by such institutions.
Although around 88 per cent of Indonesia's population is Muslim, Arabic terms such as 'Mudharabah' (profit sharing) and 'Wahdiah' (safekeeping) are unfamiliar to most Indonesians. The use of such terms also gives the impression that the concepts behind them are difficult to understand.
Indeed, a 1998 International Monetary Fund study of the role of Islamic finance in economic development recommended that measures should be taken to ensure that client unfamiliarity should not be exploited to defraud bank customers.
Given such constraints, the official aim of increasing the market share of Islamic banking in the country to 5 per cent by 2010 seems unrealistic.
Islamic bank lending in Indonesia may indeed be booming, having risen by 30 per cent last year. But while this expansion was higher than the 25.5 per cent lending growth recorded by conventional banks over the same period, the very low market share of Islamic banks makes the official target seem like an impossible dream.
To achieve the 2010 goal, existing Islamic banks - together with new ones now entering the market - would have to step up their lending to the point where bank managements give little attention to prudence.
Alternatively, the government could try curbing the loan growth of conventional banks. But since neither move makes much sense, the authorities are unlikely to pursue such options.
In other words, it will be some time before Islamic finance becomes as economically important in Indonesia as the authorities would like.
